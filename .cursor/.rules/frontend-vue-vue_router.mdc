### Guidelines for VUE

#### VUE_ROUTER

- Use route guards (beforeEach, beforeEnter) for authentication and authorization checks
- Implement lazy loading with dynamic imports for route components to improve performance
- Use named routes instead of hardcoded paths for better maintainability
- Leverage route meta fields to store additional route information like permissions or layout data
- Implement scroll behavior options to control scrolling between route navigations
- Use navigation duplicates handling to prevent redundant navigation to the current route
- Implement the composition API useRouter and useRoute hooks instead of this.$router
- Use nested routes for complex UIs with parent-child relationships
- Leverage route params validation with sensitive: true for parameters that shouldn't be logged
- Implement dynamic route matching with path parameters and regex patterns for flexible routing
